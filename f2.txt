The pdfkit module automatically wraps lines so that they fit between the margins, or in the width provided
 (when writing text in columns). In other words, change it to false when calling the text() function:
the lineBreak option is true by default. You can 

pdfDoc.text("very long text ".repeat(20), { lineBreak : false });
New pages are also added automatically as needed, i.e. as soon as 
the content you want to add doesn't fit on the current page in its 
entirety. However, you can also switch to the next page before filling
 out the previous one by simply calling:

pdfDoc.addPage();
As for alignment, pdfkit provides us with the usual options -
 left (default), right, center and justify. Note that setting a 
 specific alignment with lineBreak set to false will not work, even if the text can fit in a line.
